This is a playground app, allowing me to apply some basic music theory to my ukulele learning process.  The chords visibile are calculated from the 12 basic semitones, given the tuning of the uke, and the spelling for each chord, rendered on the fly.  It's quite a trival operation, but not one I was able to find documented anywhere.  So, I've written the code here to demonstrate music theory as applied to this instrument.
